Computer Science
================

Right now I am only taking two computer science classes since it is my first
year at Simpson. The classes I am taking are *Intro to Program* and *Web Development*.
I definitely like *Intro to Program* the most with being able to create video games,
but *Web Development* is also a interesting class that helps expand my knowledge in
creating code. Down below I go into further detail on what the classes specifically
are.

Intro to Program CMSC-150-A
---------------------------

*Intro to Program* is one of the best classes I have taken. It involves learning
the basics on how to code along with how to create codes. Throughout the class,
we have learned how to create images online, how to make people move, and how
to create video games. The final that we are working on right now is creating
a fully functional video game. I would *100%* recommend taking this class at
Simpson!


Web Development CIS-120-A
-------------------------

*Web Development* is a class that is specifically tailored to making websites.
You learn how to upload your website to the internet so that anybody in the world
can access the website at any given time. This class also has a adobe photoshop
kind of feel with creating all different kinds of designs in the website. Creating
the theme, color, and even the text of websites. If you are a person that likes
to design websites, this class will be made for you!
