Apps and Programs
-----------------

The classes within the graphic design department come in many different shapes
and forms, but we are not able to accomplish these projects without the apps that
come along within this major. The main apps used when it comes to the graphic
design department are, but are not limited to:

* Adobe Apps

    * Illustrator
    * InDesign
    * Photoshop
* Programming Apps

    * Pycharm
    * Sublime
    * Tiles

Some may think knowing all these apps is a must before starting the major, but
that is not the case at all. With the help from professors at Simpson, they will
help you every step of the way to help you understand each program.

Here are some examples of my work from almost each course and the projects that
will come up within some of the classes:
