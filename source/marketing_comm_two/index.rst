I took all of my marketing and management classes with Dr. Green who is a great person but his teaching style is one that takes time to get used to. I have had a class with him every semester except my senior year. So, I have been able to get used to his style. What I recommend is

* Read your book and other assigned reading prior to class
* Come to class with notes already written or typed up. That way you can highlight those notes and points that he brings up in class.
* Write on your tests and mark this out in questions. He writes long word problems and sometimes it is hard to figure out what he is asking especially when you are stressed with an exam.

I loved my communication classes. When I was in the middle of my freshman year when Simpson got rid of the Public Relations and introduced Marketing Communication. Therefore, there are some classes that I have taken that is no longer on the course list. One of these classes is that of Communication Research. In this class I was able to learn about the different avenues of communication research and different research tools that later helped me in my Communication Seminar in which I did individual research.

Econ was interesting because I felt as though I was struggling in it and then the other economics professor was arrested then somehow I became a tutor for the other class. So, I guess I knew and understood more than I thought that I did.
