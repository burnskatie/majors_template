My Experience with Computer Information Systems so far
======================================================

I have personally really enjoyed the Computer Science and Information Systems'
related classes on campus. They have helped me understand in a better way how
the world of technology all around us works and how complex everything technology-related can become.


Management Information Systems - CIS 145
----------------------------------------

In this class I was taught about the way businesses try to apply
technology as it is to their processes and how they process data.
Data as it is a pretty big concept, and since technology has evolved
at a really fast pace over the last few years, businesses have to
apply that technology to keep up with other companies. A pretty good
example of this would be advertising through youtube ads (which really keeps
most of us to watch out videos without interruptions or discomfort), but that is not what is covered
in this class! This class is mostly about analyzing business data and making
decisions out of it through our business analyzing skills.

Intro To Database Systems and SQL - CIS 255
-------------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered how businesses and companies store their data
and how they manage it? Me too! Which is why I am in this class.
In this class I am learning about the way some businesses and corporations
organize their information and data through SQL, a programming language
used to create queries and extract information of databases. If you like organizing
information, or are just curious about how databases work, you will enjoy this class a lot!

Introduction to programming - CMSC 150
--------------------------------------

From creating images out of shapes and colors, to creating your own video game.
Intro to programming was by far one of my favorite classes yet, and also one
of the most stressful ones too! I had no programming background whatsoever going
into this class, so some concepts became a little bit more difficult than others
when it came to understanding them. Nevertheless, this class was really fun and
it gave me a great understanding about how programming works.

Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming - CMSC 155
----------------------------------------------------------

Easily the most stressful class I have ever had (apart from Calculus), and one of the ones that have
taught me the most as well. This class takes on the subject of, as the title says, Data Structures and Object-Oriented
programming. Data Structures technically means how to set up data inside a program in the best way possible, using
Arrays, ArrayLists, Maps, Trees and many other programming concepts to your advantage. Object-Oriented programming is
the idea of creating data objects of the same type or category, through a single function, which is also pretty interesting
and cool. As a freshman I was still getting together the idea of being in college and experiencing what it was to put myself
to work and learn stuff on my own. Nevertheless, I learnt a lot from this class. One of the biggest things I learned was
how to use Java, one of the most important languages to learn in the programming world, since it is one of the most used
programming languages nowadays.
