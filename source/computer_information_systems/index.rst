    Coding is fun! [#f1]_

Computer Information Systems is, alongside Computer Science, one of the careers
with the most growth over the last few years. In contrast to Computer Science
being the most theoretical side of technology and programming, Computer Information
Systems focuses on the more applied focus on technology, usually in a more *business-like environment*.
A lot of people tend to confuse Computer Science and Computer Information Systems at first,
including myself. But once you get a better view of both fields you are able to get a better understanding of both of
them and are able to differentiate them in an easier way.
